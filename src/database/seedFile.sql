According to Electrek, Tesla has temporarily extended the range of some of its cars to help owners evacuate the area, remotely unlocking the full battery pack capacity of Model S/X 60/60D vehicles through their over-the-air software system.</p>
<p >Originally, Tesla owners could purchase a vehicle with a 75 kWh battery that was software-locked to 60 kWh range for a lower price. Owners of said battery package could lift restrictions with an added fee between $4,500 and $9,000 USD. However, in the midst of the current natural crisis, Tesla has lifted the restriction for owners who had not done so in Florida, extending the capacity with an extra 30 or 40 miles of range. This came to light after a few owners reported that their cars had more range than usual this morning.</p><p >Tesla has confirmed that the electric automaker has put in place the emergency measure to temporarily extend the range of vehicles of Tesla owners in the path of Hurricane Irma.</p><p >Here’s how you can help hurricane Irma victims: American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity’s Hurrican Recovery and donation page, Airbnb, National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, Volunteer Florida.</p></div>',

  'Featuring studio images, a collection of essays, and more.',
  '<div class="blog_text_content"><img class="blog_banner blog_images" src="/images/hypebeast_images/blogImages/our_legacy_book.jpg" /><p>Over the past 12 years, Swedish label <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/our-legacy">Our Legacy</a> has made a name for itself through collections that mix high-end minimalism with experimental touches. The brand has now unveiled a limited-edition book that will examine the its history through a series of questions about the brand and its collections. These questions include “how are these first garments perceived today, and how do they correlate with current collections more progressive take on menswear?” and “how can the brand’s “legacy” be understood in a world that is so different than what it was then?”</p><p>Other features in the book, named Self_Titled: A Book About Our Legacy, include archive pieces, studio images, and a series of essays on everything from masculinity, to the story behind the brand’s name. Priced at £55 GBP (approximately $72 USD), the book is available now from the brands <a href="https://www.ourlegacy.se/product/self_titled-a-book-about-our-legacy">webstore</a>, but you’ll have to move quickly as the first run is limited to just 1,000 copies.</p><p>To mark the launch of the book, the brand’s co-founder <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jockum-hallin">Jockum Hallin</a> sat down with Vogue. You can read some key excerpts from that interview below, and head over to the publication’s <a href="http://www.vogue.com/article/our-legacy-20th-anniversary-book">site</a> to check out the whole thing.</p><h4 class="sectiom_heading">On the brands name:</h4><p>“It came from the idea that we were taking the legacy of previous generations and adapting it to our times and our lives. Along the way, we found our own language, and people started to categorize us, put us in a corner. So around 2012 we decided to take a break; we wanted to be freer to do what we want and not just what people expected us to. We took a year off and reinvented ourselves, and things have been amazing since. We took a more progressive approach, pushed ourselves forward, saw what we can really do.”</p><h4>On the brands current influences:</h4><p>“Both <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/christopher-nying">Christopher [Nying</a>, co-founder and creative director] and I became who we are during the ‘90s, so the subcultural things that we were into back then are slowly seeping into the collections.</p><h4>On the book:</h4><p>“We didn’t want the book to feel like a retrospective. We don’t want people to categorize us; people won’t know if something is from 2017 or 1997. There are things that you can get really dig into and get lost in; there are detail shots in the books, really funny personal things—old boots, Pez dispensers.

After months of leaks and dummy phones, we already have a pretty good idea of what the iPhone 8 is going to look like, but until today there hasn’t been any info regarding how the phone will function.</p><p>In the leaked video, we get a relatively clear look at the new bezel-less screen which looks to feature an impressive 18:9 aspect ratio. But the most interesting part of the video is a look at how Apple is building its iOS around the polarizing notch cutout which houses the speaker, front-facing camera and sensors. The video reveals the cellular, WiFi and battery status indicators will be moving to the right of the notch while the in dash time will move to the left. Take a first look at a working Apple iPhone 8 here or below and let us know what you think.</p><p>Also, take a look at the some of the designs and features of the Apple iPhone 8 that were confirmed in the latest model leak.</p></div>',

  '<div class="blog_text_content"><img class="blog_banner blog_images" src="/images/hypebeast_images/blogImages/nate_diaz_mcgregor.jpg" /><p>Though the big fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather has come and gone, attention on superfighter McGregor remains largely active. Though many MMA fighters — and fans alike — highly-praised McGregor for stepping into the boxing ring to fight one of today’s best boxers, McGregor’s rivalry Nate Diaz had very different sentiments on his mind.</p><p>Taking to his personal Instagram, Diaz took shots at both McGregor and the UFC for the bout.</p><p></p><p>“He punched himself out the same way he lost in the UFC. No learning going on. #Overpromotion bullshit, get off the nuts this the shit I’m talking about, Bruce Lee would’ve never lost like that. #RealNinjaShit”</p><p>Diaz’s jab most likely also stems from the fact that McGregor — whose stamina has been of question — couldn’t keep up with Mayweather, resulting in the referee calling a stop to the fight in Round 10. With all this animosity still left in the air between the pair, will we be seeing McGregor and Diaz heading back into the Octagon for a third time?</p><p>Head over to our Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor fight life feed to relive one of the most-talked about sporting events in history.</p></div>',

  '<div class="blog_text_content"><img class="blog_banner blog_images" src="/images/hypebeast_images/blogImages/pause_building_design.jpg" /><p>Iran-based space “Pause” is the latest project by Amir Hossein Ashari and is designed to showcase the stars in a unique way. Constructed with large sheets of metal, the exhibit sees bricks organized in a spiral pattern. Guests are encouraged to stand in the middle of the spiral and look directly above them through the hole cut through the top of the box. Aiming straight at the sky, the hole offers viewers an unobstructed look at the stars above them.
</p><p>With the bricks acting as a barrier between the outside world and the view of the stars, “Pause” is designed to eliminate any outside distractions and encourage users to focus solely on their view through the top window. By doing this, Ashari hopes that those who enter “Pause” can take some time to relax, meditate, and realign themselves. Take a look at a few pictures above and for more breathtaking design, read up on the upcoming tour for Tokujin Yoshioka’s Prismatic Glass Tea House.</p></div>',

Explaining the magazine, managing editor, Stephen Pulvirent, told Business of Fashion that it won’t be strictly watch-only, but rather “this is a more general interest men’s lifestyle magazine that is inspired by a type of person who we know to be interested in watches.”</p><p>The HODINKEE magazine will not be available on typical newsstands, but the publication will instead be sold through the website and through hospitality partners including Soho House. There’s no news yet on when the first issue will drop, so keep checking back for more information.</p><p>In other watch news, TAG Heuer has recently announced a new exhibition that will take place in 10 different countries simultaneously.</p></div>',
